[{"content":"Using Windows for Everything\rOver the course the past 15 years, dual booting was a mainstay in my lifestyle. I used a MacBook pro for my creative work such as DJing and music creation, and kept the gaming on my windows desktop, and most of the tinkering on a separate partition with Fedora Linux.\nOver time however, the setup began to show its age. Not only was my hardware becoming outdated, but it also turns out I would spend time working on a project in Linux land, then I would be sidetracked by some new game I wanted to play in Windows, and finally I would spend a couple months making strides on some musical endeavors using my Mac. In other words, I would move from system to system, rarely finishing projects, and having difficulty keeping track of where I left off when I would return.\nIt seemed to me that the best solution would be all-in-one. As opposed to using three different operating systems for all the tasks I set out to do, it seemed to me that a single, powerful computer would be perfectly sufficient for all my needs. This time though, there would be no dual booting. I had to settle on a single operating system.\nWhy Windows?\rI\u0026rsquo;ve been dual booting Linux on all my Windows Machines since 2003. I truly wanted to be all in with Linux. UNIX filesystems, the gnu toolchain, the beauty of the shell. Everything from the freedom of open source and libre philosophy to the way it all worked, I was a true believer. But I wanted to play games. Not to mention music. And\u0026hellip; oh never mind. Linux never became the definitive operating system that I wanted it to be for me. The audio latency and driver issues, the graphic drivers issues (looking at you NVIDIA), the anti-cheat issues, and so on and so forth. For this all-in-one project it just won\u0026rsquo;t do.\nI certainly considered mac, but one of my goals was to be able to change out parts as needed so I wanted to use some parts from my last PC in order to save money. Since I can\u0026rsquo;t build my own Mac (officially, that is) I chose Windows as the Operating System.\nWhat I Discovered\rAfter using Windows exclusively for a little over a year, I\u0026rsquo;ve come away mighty impressed. There have been improvements to every aspect of the experience since the days of yore. Windows can be tiled, the powershell has been upgraded to be an extremely powerful experience nearly on par with its linux equivalents, it has package managers such as scoop or chocolatey, and I even have my favorite text editor neovim. Running git, testing my hugo pages, and using VScode all has integrated into my windows usage with minimal learning curve, and I am here for it.\nOn the audio side of my life, Windows is unable to match the utter brilliance of Core Audio. However, Windows stands head and shoulders above my experience with Linux. Fighting the issues running my favorite plugins, issues with drivers, and issues generally all around became altogether a non-starter. Once I got the correct drivers set up in Windows, everything really became mostly seamless. I certainly ran into some baffling issues such as needing to run Ableton as administrator in order to properly prioritize the program and its plugins in order to reduce latency, and an issue where I couldn\u0026rsquo;t watch youtube videos while running audio software simultaneously. Once I solved those issues, everything truly just works. I spend the majority of my creative time creating. A truly beautiful thing.\nI suppose I should mention gaming. while it\u0026rsquo;s certainly the least concerning issue to me, Windows just absolutely blows every other operating system out of the water in this regard. When I want to play a game, my good old Radeon RX 580 is still giving me plenty of leg room. I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to throw a game at it that just won\u0026rsquo;t run (with the glaring exception of Gothic II. What gives?!)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s so many aspects of this I still want to touch on, such as Windows Subsystem for Linux and amp sims for guitar, but I\u0026rsquo;ll save those for the future. Most of my activities have been able to be relegated to a single corner in my living room, which has been vital since I no longer have a designated office space. Having the PC in one place, ready to go for every project I throw at it has helped keep things focused in a way I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced before. In conclusion, using one Windows PC for all my activities this year has proven to be a very fruitful endeavor.\n","date":"2024-11-29T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/uploads/windows.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/using_windows/","title":"Using Windows for Everything"},{"content":"\nStarting something new. A new beginning or starting over. Sometimes it’s triggered by a desire to begin a new project, or we set a new goal, and other times we face it because of hard drive failure or a divorce. The funny thing about starting is that it’s a problem that’s as old as time. There are so many excuses not to start. Some might say \u0026ldquo;never put off till tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow,\u0026rdquo; as stated by Mark Twaine, or Oscar Wilde, or someone like that. and others may just be avoiding making payments, not unlike J. Wellington Wimpy. If creating something from nothing requires a grandiose god to accomplish such a feat, how is a mere mortal expected to do the same?\nI’ve described some situations where we might have to start something. The first few issues raised when I’m faced with the problem of starting tend to be: Do I have the materials I need? E.g. Do I have the money? Do I have the equipment? Once I can confirm that I have at least the minimum amount of what I need, do I have the skills? And if I have the skills, do I have a plan? And if I have a plan and I have the skills, do I have the time? And if I have the plan, I have the skills, and I have the time and I have what I need but I still don’t have the mechanical keyboard that I want, then maybe I should spend a few hours on amazon lusting over the best option because it’s just got to be the best, and it turns out I can’t afford it but now I don’t have time, so I better put it off until tomorrow.\nTomorrow Never Comes\rIt’s true. The mythical tomorrow truly never comes. Any time we procrastinate, there’s a ripple effect that resonates far and wide throughout our lives. Dreams unfulfilled, business not dealt, promises broken, pride, self-worth, and trustworthiness diminished. These reasons and more are some strong arguments for starting. It’s never going to be done until it’s begun. So, I’ve decided to begin. But does it live up to my expectations? Could it be better? Maybe I should throw it out. I’ve just hit possibly the biggest hurdle in my journey of creation.\nPerfectionism\rAt last I’ve started. The formless is beginning to take shape. Projects are closing in on the finish lines and debts are being snowballed. But I can’t publish. I give up half way through, another Ableton session never to be opened again. It just didn’t work out, and even if it could be worked out, I don’t have the time, the skills, the tools, nor do I have a plan. This is the dark place, and there is no lantern to light the way.\nSo how does one \u0026quot;un-stuck\u0026quot; themselves from this rut? Perhaps the best solution is just to start, start again, and somehow yet again. Do I simply keep drinking from that immaterial substance that brought the big bang of initial inspiration, or do I wait for a new cow to arrive from a pasture unknown?\nThe Truth Hurts\rIt\u0026rsquo;s never going to be perfect. Nothing done in this life is ever going to be perfect. Like building sandcastles, eventually all will be broken down by the waves of the ocean of life itself. No matter how much effort put in or planning that’s been done, there can always be better. How can I be happy with the final result? I’m a maximizer, not a satisficer, and I know it could be better. This sentiment has been shared with nearly all creators the world over, but at some point, one just has to stop, give it the seal of approval, and move on to another new project and start the whole process over again. Or perhaps I’ll put it off today and just wait until tomorrow.\n","date":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/uploads/cover.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/blog/starting/","title":"The Problem of Starting"}]
